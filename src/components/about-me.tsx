                student and developer with a few years of experience working on open-source
                projects. I love turning ideas into real, functional productsâ€”especially when it
                means building fast, modern web apps that are both clean and scalable. I enjoy
                working where design meets engineering and creating things that are both practical
                and polished.

                I&apos;m always learning, whether it&apos;s picking up new frameworks, optimizing
                performance, or rethinking how I approach a problem. For me, every project is a
                chance to grow, get better, and push myself to build smarter, more impactful
                software.
